The real world experiments are done in an office environment at three different time intervals in a day (16:19, 17:07 and 18:41).

16:19 is the time when InPocket_crowded experiments are made (ScriptsForAllCases/1619_InPocket_crowded folder)
17:07 is the time when InHand_Crowded experiments are made (ScriptsForAllCases/1707_InHand_Crowded folder)
18:41 is the time when InPocket_NonCrowded experiments are made (ScriptsForAllCases/1841_InPocket_NonCrowded folder)

The experiments where real world data RSSIs used in the receivers can be found in folder "RealWorldRSSIs/" whereas the experiments where the simulation generated RSSIs is used in the receivers can be found in folder "SimulationGeneratedRSSIs/".

Real World RSSIs are collected by walking in the indoor environment (online part) and by running the algorithm offline (which produces the same result with running the algorithm purely online due to real world data)
Simulation generated RSSIs are generated by IP-PPFONM simulation tool while running the algorithm offline (can only be done offline since)

If fingerprinting information is used, then both "RealWorldRSSIs" and "SimulationGeneratedRSSIs" experiments take this into account. They only differ in the usage of RSSIs in the receivers at each time step.


In ScriptsForAllCases folder of the related experiments, in the scripts starting with the name "realOfficeSimulationGeneral", there is a parameter called "MAX_ITR_TO_LOOK_FOR" which is only used in real-world RealWorldRSSIs. This parameter looks "MAX_ITR_TO_LOOK_FOR-1" time step into past and the future to find a signal if no signal is found in the current time step. The reason is that, to compensate for non-received signals in real-time and trying to calculate a distance information at least using a receiver to give more correct results. In real time; the looking into the future part should be replaced by waiting "MAX_ITR_TO_LOOK_FOR-1" time step.

For both "RealWorldRSSIs" and "SimulationGeneratedRSSIs", ground truth position data from "50 seconds of walking" is used in all cases. These are just sample position data obtained by watching fish-eye lensed camera results during a selected 50 second time interval. There are also RSSI data gathered at the receivers during our whole walk in the office (more than 50 seconds and different for all cases) which can be found in GroundTruth_Position_and_RSSI_Values/AllRSSIValues folder.
The 50 distance  extacted from this can be found in GroundTruth_Position_and_RSSI_Values/GroundTruthPositions_50second folder.

The scripts named:
	
	-> "realOfficeSimulationGeneral_print..." expects ground truth value to be present in the folder it resides in in csv format (e.g. AllValues1619_salt.csv). 
	In RealWorldRSSIs, "realOfficeSimulationGeneral_print..." scripts expect TWO command line arguments where the first parameter being "adjustableSignalErrorInEnv" which strengthens/corrects the received signal for more correct distance calculations and the second parameter being the ground truth file ; however, in "SimulationGeneratedRSSIs", these scripts expect only ONE command line argument and it is the ground truth file for ground truth positions to generate the RSSIs from and to calculate the accuracy.  In RealWorldRSSIs, we use the ground truth file only for accuracy calculations and not to generate RSSIs as in SimulationGeneratedRSSIs  since we use the ground truth RSSIs from "AllRSSIValues" .csv files (SimulationGeneratedRSSIs does not use the ground truth RSSI information here; just uses "AllRSSIValues" .csv files to determine the #of iterations (time steps/seconds) of the algorithm) -> THIS IS IMPORTANT to understand the difference between generated RSSIs and real-world RSSIs

	-> "calculate_mean_std_realworld..." expects ground-truth file (extracted 50 sample positions from whole walk) and result file (the means for each time step obtained by running corresponding "realOfficeSimulationGeneral_print..." script) as the 1st and 2nd parameters and then calculates the mean error and standard deviation of erros for the related experiment.

	-> "calculate_mean_std_speed_from_groundtruth..." expect ground truth file (extracted 50 sample positions from whole walk) to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the speed while we walk around in the office to have an idea about how-fast we are and how much our speed varies during walking.

There are "50 .png files" and a "..._mu" file in each of the cases in "ScriptsForAllCases" folders. These represent the simulation and mean error output at each time step obtained by running "realOfficeSimulationGeneral_print..." scripts.
